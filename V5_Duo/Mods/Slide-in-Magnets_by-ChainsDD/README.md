# Nevermore V5 Duo w/ Slide-in Magnets

I got tired of my magnets falling out, even after I had glued them, So I cooked up this mod.

After printing, just slide your magnets in from the top. Push the first magnet all the way to the bottom, and the second until you feel it slip into it's pocket. There's a whole on the bottom of the parts in case you need to remove the magnets.

There's two versions of the plenum, one with and one without a Waho mount on the back side. Use two 221-413 wagos for simpler, solder free wiring.

The cartrige uses the normal lids that can be found in the v2 folder. The plenum has a modified lid, so use the one here.

For extra cool points, print both lids with a color swap at about the 4th layer.
